This is a project based on Mark Aikens' AppleII-VGA.

Ideally, if successfull it will run firmware which would have switchable video output to one of the VGA or HDMI ports.
So far the board has been designed with the impedance calculations for the HDMI port - to be honest, my first attempt, I hope I got that right.
The idea is to make the original firmware work via the VGA output, which should not cause any troubles.
After that the firmware for the HDMI part needs to be developped.
